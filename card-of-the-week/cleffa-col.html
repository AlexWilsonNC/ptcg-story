                <h3>Eeeeeeek</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Talk about an iconic card. There's always one card in every format that finds its way into nearly every deck, and Cleffa is by far one of the most historically remembered one to this day. Such an incredibly strong card, some players loved it, many hated it. Why? Let's take a look.</p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week zoomed' src='../assets/cards/2010-2012/cleffa-hgss.png' alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                    <img class='card-of-the-week zoomed' src='../assets/cards/2010-2012/cleffa-col.png' alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                </div>
                <p>First off, Cleffa was not only printed in Call of Legends, I just love its artwork more for the thumbnail. The first "Eeeeeeek" Cleffa on the left was printed in HeartGold SoulSilver base set in 2010, one year prior. Call of Legends acted as a celebratory set, like Crown Zenith and Legendary Treasures, which reprinted many cards with new artwork.</p>
                <p>Not to be confused with the original "Eeeeeeek" Cleffa from Neo Genesis, nor the "Eek" Cleffa Black Star promo , nor the "Eeeeeek" Cleffa from Unseen Forces, nor the "Eeek" Cleffa from Diamond & Pearl either... There's been a lot of Eeeking in the Pok√©mon TCG.</p>
                <p>Baby Pok√©mon have always had a gimmick, and in HeartGold SoulSilver, their era's gimmick was free retreat, no weakness nor resistance, no attack cost, and they couldn't be damaged from attacks when Asleep. Because who could harm a sleeping baby?!</p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week-small zoomed' src='../assets/card-otw/pichu.png' alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                    <img class='card-of-the-week-small zoomed' src='../assets/card-otw/tyrogue.png' alt='pokemon card of the week' />

                    <img class='card-of-the-week-small zoomed' src='../assets/card-otw/smoochum.png' alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                </div>
                <p>The latter of which being the key component to their success. Cleffa could refresh a bad hand or even strengthen an opening turn, and as long as you flipped tails during checkup, your opponent couldn't do anything to Cleffa! And in 2011, after the emergency rotation prior to the <a href='../major-events/2011/us-nats/summary' target='_blank'>2011 US National Championships</a>, there weren't many ways to deal with an active Pok√©mon that was simingly untouchable. There was Pok√©mon Reversal, which was the same as a Pok√©mon Catcher that required a coin flip. But that was about it, as there were no supporters like Boss's Orders, and Warp Point had just rotated. The only way to deal with a sleeping baby on the field, was to either wait patiently to attack, flip heads off a Reversal, ping it with damage counters or with a special condition, or greet your opponent with a sleeping baby of your own. And that's what most players did, nearly every deck in the format played baby Pok√©mon. (singular and plural)</p>
                <p>Take a look at just how many decks played Cleffa and other babies in the 2011 Worlds format: <a href='../decks-by-era/2011/hgss-bw' target="_blank">Decks by Era: 2011 HGSS-BW</a></p>
                <p>Cleffa was the most useful of the lot. It was a powerful draw Supporter in the form of a free attack, with the added buff of, "maybe my opponent won't be able to KO it". Which sounds great, some of you may have already started to think that a Cleffa in today's Standard format would be a great idea. Well, I wouldn't jump to such a conclusion so fast...</p>
                <p>This era of baby Pok√©mon came with a major flaw, and I'm not so sure whether the game designers had even thought it out in full or not. Many players and decks were relying on these baby Pok√©mon to set up their boards each and every game, so much so, that games sometimes were not progressing! Dubbed "Baby wars", created long drawn-out stalemates, and sometimes they were a problem.</p>
                <img class='article-content-image' src='../assets/card-otw/cleffa-many.jpg' alt='many cleffa'>
                <p>If Player 1 üë¶ Eeeeeeeks and flips tails, meaning their baby remains asleep, Player 2 üëß has little to no choice but to utilize a baby of their own as well. Player 2 üëß uses Eeeeeeek too, and also filp tails. Going into Player 1's üë¶ turn, they then flips heads, but alas can't attack because Player 2 üëß is asleep. What does Player 1 üë¶ do? They use Eeeeeeek again, because why not, one could always use another hand of 6 fresh cards. But what's this? Player 1 üë¶ flipped heads, meaning their Cleffa wakes up! This of course means that Player 2 üëß could now KO Player 1's üë¶ Cleffa, but Player 2 üëß still needs to flip for their sleep-check before they can begin their turn. Player 2 üëß flips tails into their turn, unable to attack, unable to retreat... Play continues into Player 1's üë¶ turn, and they can't attack the still-asleep Player 2 üëß, thus they use their baby again!</p>
                <p>See the problem?</p>
                <p>Baby wars often times made for some disgusting cycles. And while I absolutely love the HeartGold SoulSilver era, I for one am incredibly glad that I don't have to deal with baby wars outside of playing with these retro decks.</p>
