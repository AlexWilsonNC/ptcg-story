        <p class='italic'>" I've been playing the Pokemon Trading Card Game since 2010, but I've been enveloped by Pokemon since I was in Kindergarten, which is for as long as I can remember... While I'm more so known for being a top competitor in the XY - Sun & Moon era, I'm an avid "retro" deck collector, and love reminiscing on the past of my favorite hobby. Often times, I find myself scrolling through old forums looking for decks that I may have forgotten about, or re-watching Worlds streams late at night.</p>
        <br> 
        <p class='italic'>While there's been plenty of sites out there that have provided amazing information, they all seemed to stick to one niche, only decklists, just results, players stats.... Personally, I was tired of having to remember which website contained whichever desired info that I was searching for, thus, I took things into my own hands and created this massive site that has every possible grain of information about historic, past events, one could ever hope for.</p>
        <br> 
        <p class='italic'>I recently became a web developer, so this was an enjoyable side project while practing outside of my full-time development job. This is what I've always envisioned in a retro TCG website, so I hope you all enjoy the content that can be found here and I hope to meet you at events throughout the future. "</p>
