                <hr class='title-hr'>

                    <p>For many retro players, the question of ‚ÄúWhen does a format become retro‚Äù occasionally crosses their mind. A lot of players, with good reason, currently have ‚Äúretro‚Äù format decks built up until 2019 Worlds (UPR-UNM) or 2019-20 Ultra Prism - Cosmic Eclipse. Besides the printed World Championship Decks, you won‚Äôt find too many people with decks built for formats during or following the pandemic era of the game.</p>
                        
                        <p>While many of the formats during (and following) this era are some of my least favorite formats that I‚Äôve been unfortunate enough to play in, a few formats have caught my (and others) attention for good candidates to revisit by building decks for. While it may seem outlandish to archive these relatively recent metagames, I think it‚Äôs important to remember that many players started their competitive journey in this era, and will be happy to revisit them down the road. Getting to play old formats with players, new and old, is one of my greatest joys in this game, and I‚Äôm sure many other retro players have similar sentiments.</p>
                        
                        <p>Also, there‚Äôs no such thing as a bad gateway drug (except maybe 2011 MD-BLW) to get your newer player friends into other retro formats.</p>
                        
                        <p>I‚Äôve chosen 5 formats for this article. 1 of which I have built myself, 2 which I aspire to do soon, and 2 that I‚Äôve seen others either build already or consider building. For the sake of organization, I‚Äôll be listing these chronologically. Keep in mind that my ratings of formats are my personal opinion.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Format 1: 2021 Sword & Shield Base - Evolving Skies (SSH-EVS)</h3>
                        
                        <p>Skill: 4/10
                        Affordability: 10/10 
                        Personal Enjoyment 3/10</p>
                        
                        <p>Recommended Gauntlet Size: 4-8 decks</p>
                        
                        <p>The first format following the rotation of Tag Team GX Pokemon is a favorite of Simon (@StarshineSimon) on Twitter. This format heavily features VMAX Pokemon, alongside the near ubiquitous Drizzile / Inteleon engine and the Single and Rapid Strike Battle Styles. With Sun & Moon control cards and Tag Teams in the rear-view mirror, this format felt like the first Sword & Shield format that identified with the general design principles. 
                        https://twitter.com/StarshineSimon/status/1647340416373608450</p>
                        
                        <p>Pros: 
                        -Inteleon engine is one of the most interesting engines in the games history, providing search, set up, and damage modification. 
                        -Inteleon engine gives decks lots of flexibility in Trainer card techs
                        -There are many different usable archetypes in this format
                        -Most decks have a consistent setup with the Inteleon engine. 
                        -Lots of spread strategies and healing cards can throw off the monotony of games
                        -Some cool rogue decks
                        -Playable eeveelutions</p>
                        
                        <p>Cons:
                        -This format was coined as the ‚ÄúInteleon line + your favorite color VMAX format‚Äù due to how deck building was heavily focused around the Drizzile Inteleon engine. 
                        -Going first was a significant advantage in a format with 3 Prize Pokemon that usually 2 hit KO each other. 
                        -Weakness decided many matchups from my experience.
                        -VMAX Pokemon make games go quickly
                        -While the Inteleon engine gives players incredible flexibility in deckbuilding, the games in this format felt to me lacking in skill expression once players figured out how to properly use the engine and resources. 
                        -If you don‚Äôt like Inteleon, you don‚Äôt like this format</p>
                        
                        <p>My review of SSH-EVS may not be glowing, but some players would tell you otherwise and regard it as one of their favorites. With all of the cards of the format having rotated from the Standard format, there‚Äôs never been a better time to build this format.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Format 2: 2022 Sword & Shield Base - Brilliant Stars (SSH-BRS)</h3>
                        
                        <p>Skill: 4/10
                        Affordability: 8/10 
                        Personal Enjoyment 6.5/10</p>
                        
                        <p>Recommended Gauntlet Size: 4-8 decks</p>
                        
                        <p>On March 3rd, 2022 I looked outside my window and saw an Absol. Then, I looked at my computer monitor, where Palkia VSTAR had just been revealed. Absol warned me of the disaster that was soon to come. With great haste I assembled SSH-BRS, knowing it would be the best Sword & Shield series format we‚Äôd ever get with disaster looming on the horizon.</p> 
                        
                        (pic via limitlesstcg)
                        
                        <p>The Brilliant Stars format starlights some stellar new Pokemon to add to the previous EVS with the addition of Arceus VSTAR and the recently departed Mew VMAX. Arceus VSTAR is undoubtedly the highlight of this format as it features in many of the top decks. While every format since has relegated Arceus to a few variants, there are a dozen Arceus VSTAR partners in this format. Mew VMAX, Rapid Strike Urshifu VMAX, and Gengar VMAX bring representation for the 3 Battle Styles. There are also fun rogues that succeeded like Whimsicott VSTAR and Zoroark Control Box.</p>
                        
                        <p>Pros: 
                        -lots of deck variety, if Arceus variants are considered different decks
                        -Fun rogue decks
                        -Fusion Strike engine and Bibarel add different viable engines outside of Inteleon
                        -VSTARs and viable single prize decks allow many different types of decks and longer games
                        -Same techability in Inteleon decks as EVS
                        -Arceus VSTAR partner techs for the meta
                        -Great Arceus VSTAR mirrors</p>
                        
                        <p>Cons:
                        -Mew VMAX isn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs favorite deck
                        -Significant role of weakness in the meta, but Dunsparce in Arceus decks can prevent this
                        -Lots of Arceus VSTAR
                        -Few top decks, if Arceus variants are not considered different decks</p>
                        
                        <p>While I enjoy this format, I know it‚Äôs not for everyone. Maybe my love for Whimsicott gives me rose-tinted glasses, or maybe my love of infinitely techable Arceus builds excites me. This format also costs more than EVS for most decks, since Arceus VSTAR (somehow) has not fallen to a cheap price since its release. Still, I think it has some great mirrors and very fun rogue decks that make it fun to revisit.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Format 3: 2022 Sword & Shield - Lost Origin (SSH-LOR)</h3>
                        
                        <p>Skill: 6/10
                        Affordability: 8/10 
                        Personal Enjoyment 5/10</p>
                        
                        <p>Recommended Gauntlet Size: 4-6 decks</p>
                        
                        <p>Don‚Äôt worry about 2022 Worlds, we‚Äôre skipping past that. Lost Origin brought the Lost Zone back to the game with the iconic Lost Zone engine. The variable Lost Zone decks are a lot of fun to play. Previous top decks like Mew VMAX, Palkia VSTAR, and Arceus VSTAR (though more limited) continue to succeed. Regigigas also gains its awaited Gift Energy to finally see consistent success.</p>
                        
                        <p>Pros:
                        -Many different deck engines (Bibarel, Inteleon, Lost Zone, Fusion Strike System)
                        -Lost Zone decks can be very fun to play
                        -Hisuian Heavy Ball lowers the impact of bad prizing</p>
                        
                        <p>Cons:
                        -Palkia VSTAR is still a dominant deck that is suffocating to play against. It gained a new partner, Kyurem VMAX. 
                        -Limited single prize viability outside of Lost Zone and Regigigas
                        -Small pool of viable decks, Lost Zone decks gatekeep evolving Pokemon 
                        -Arceus variants are more limited</p>
                        
                        <p>While I think the Lost Zone engine is really fun to revisit, I think Palkia VSTAR puts me off of building this format. I do think that the format was not as solved as the formats that followed it, as Lost Zone lists were initially pretty different. Giratina VSTAR unfortunately did not get the Battle Deck treatment, so it is still a relatively pricey card, as of writing. Radiant Greninja and Radiant Charizard also give decks an extra added expense.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Format 4: 2023 (Worlds) Battle Styles - Paldea Evolved (BST-PAL)</h3>
                        
                        <p>Skill: 6/10
                        Affordability: 7/10 
                        Personal Enjoyment 7/10</p>
                        
                        <p>Recommended Gauntlet Size: 4-8 decks</p>
                        
                        <p>While we got a dud Worlds format for 2022, that isn‚Äôt the case for 2023. Scarlet & Violet breathed new life into the TCG with lots of powerful evolving ex Pokemon and Stage 2 supporting Pokemon. Old faces from Sword & Shield were hard to overcome though, so many of the best decks in this format still feature VSTARs. Mew VMAX takes its revenge after being underestimated by players. </p>
                        
                        <p>Pros:
                        -4 World Championship Printed Decks (Mew, Gardevoir, Lost Zone Kyogre, and Lugia) provide easy entry into building this format
                        -Lots of fun decks to play
                        -Different tier 2 variants of tier 1 decks to try out if you get bored (ie. Gardevoir ex / Mewtwo V-UNION)
                        -Many different kinds of engines, nearly every deck plays a unique engine
                        -Iono and Reversal Energy add comeback potential 
                        -Hisuian Heavy Ball lowers the impact of bad prizing</p>
                        
                        <p>Cons:
                        -Unless you‚Äôre willing to proxy w/ World Championship prints, many of the VSTARs are still pricey. 
                        -Forest Seal Stone and Radiants are additionally expensive
                        -Despite losing about half its power level, Lugia VSTAR is still very good in this meta, with 2 top variants. While each one has its own strengths and weaknesses, both of them open 2 Archeops + Ultra Ball and play the rest of the game on auto-pilot
                        -Some new decks are gatekept by old decks, especially decks relying on single prize evolving Pokemon, which get harassed by Lost Zone Sableye. 
                        -Some high rolly decks. Between required Battle VIP passes in most decks to set up and Electric Generator spamming Miraidon decks, some games can come down to the opening turn
                        -Limited number of viable decks (excluding variants)</p>
                        
                        <p>With lots of fun cards and interesting decks, I expect this to be a format that many people gravitate towards in the coming years. In casual play, Gardevoir may be even stronger than it was at the time, since it won‚Äôt have a pesky timer to take away its deserved wins. This Worlds format showed the potential of the Scarlet & Violet cards. We would see this potential fully realized in the next format I‚Äôll cover.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Format 5: 2023 Battle Styles - Paldean Fates (BST-PAF)</h3>
                        
                        <p>Skill: 7/10
                        Affordability: 7/10 
                        Personal Enjoyment 8/10</p>
                        
                        <p>Recommended Gauntlet Size: 4-8 decks</p>
                        
                        <p>With more Scarlet & Violet sets available, the ghosts of the VSTAR era slowly fade away, but champions like Giratina VSTAR still dominate. New Stage 2 competition in Charizard keeps these old threats on their toes, and the new aggressive Ancient and Future Pokemon show up to challenge the rank of older aggressive decks like Miraidon. Control rears its head for the first time in a year with incredible new tools gifted to it by Pokemon 151 and Paradox Rift. Cards from E block make one final showing in their last Standard format.</p>
                        
                        <p>Pros: 
                        -An incredible amount of mechanics available to choose from (Battle Styles, Paradox, V, VMAX, VSTAR, V-Union, ex, Tera ex, Radiant)
                        -Many of the decks utilize these different mechanics to feel unique from one another.
                        -Very good Stage 2 decks in Gardevoir ex and Charizard ex
                        -Many fun to play decks, great matchups
                        -Iono, Reversal Energy, and NEW Counter Catcher add comeback potential 
                        -Lugia VSTAR takes a back seat in the meta
                        -Control is back in the meta (is not suffocating though)
                        -Technical Machines offer lots of deck building creativity with Arven
                        -Large pool of legal cards, since its at the end of a rotation
                        -Some fun rogues (Tord Reklev Charizard pile, Klawf/Electrode)
                        -Many techable Basic Pokemon to help matchups (Jirachi, Manaphy, Spiritomb)</p>
                        
                        <p>Cons:
                        -As with any Battle VIP pass format, a bad opening turn can spell trouble for some decks.
                        -The meta decks have very solved lists, with little deckbuilding left to do
                        -Due to most of the cards being Standard legal and recently released, many cards in this format have not hit their price low yet
                        -If you hate control, you won‚Äôt love seeing it here
                        -Iron Hands brings back everyone‚Äôs favorite game effect of punishing set up decks and single prize Pokemon. 
                        -Some decks feel impossible to beat if they get a perfect set up (Gardevoir, Chien-Pao)</p>
                        
                        <p>While this format is only a month gone, as of the time of writing this, I find myself loathing the current Standard format and wishing I could play another few sets of full power Gardevoir ex. This format is, in my opinion, the best Standard format following the introduction of 3 Prize Pokemon in February 2019. I‚Äôm not the only one to notice this, though. A few other retro players are already watching the prices of cards, waiting for them to drop, so they can play this format for years to come.</p>
                        
                        <p>Thanks for reading. While you may not share my sentiments of what formats stand out from the 2020s, I hope you‚Äôve at least gotten a chance to think back on the time spent in the shadow of Generation 8. While we haven‚Äôt truly recovered from the Tag Team epidemic yet, I think there are some fun formats to revisit from these years (especially Paradox Rift and Paldean Fates). If this article didn‚Äôt do enough convincing for me, I‚Äôm sure I can rely on Lugia VSTAR, aggressive Item gust, and Iron Hands ex to take people‚Äôs minds off Standard for a minute.</p>
