            <div class='article-content'>
                <p><span style='margin-left: 15px;'>Quite</span> often, I hear players arguing over who the best player in the world is, and I mean, often... Local events, messenger chats, friends at work, and on social media. This has always been a hot topic throughout the game's lifetime, but never more so than throughout the last few years. I recently indulged in one of these conversations with friends after the conculsion of the 2023 World Championships, and really started thinking hard on who I believe to be the five best players of all time are.</p>
                <p>As a reminder before we delve too deep into this, these rankings are of my opinion. You do not have to agree with me, however I do hope that some of the points and information I include in this article are useful when you are thinking of your own Top "<i>x </i>" list. (<i>NOTE:</i> I am leaving players from the Asia-Pacific region out of this list's consideration. With the vastly different and secluded circuit they compete in, it's incredibly difficult to compare accomplishments to the Play! Pokémon structure that we're more familiar with. I can think of so many players from this region that are among some of the best players of all time, <i>ex. Takuya Yoneda, Shintaro Ito, Tsuguyoshi Yamato, Yuta Komatsuda, Sejun Park, Ryota Ishiyama, Daichi Shimada</i> and so many more. But, without knowing what other accomplishments these players have had in their own circuits outside of the World Championships, it's very difficult for me to include them in my Top 5 list.) With that out of the way, let's get into it.</p> 
                <p>The Top 5 Greatest Players in History! From 5<sup>th</sup> to 1<sup>st</sup>:</p>

                <!-- 5 -->
                <div class='align-row'>
                    <h3>5. Azul Griego</h3>&nbsp;
                    <a class='twit-link' href='https://twitter.com/Azul_GG?s=20' target="_blank">@Azul_GG</a>
                </div>
                <p>Fresh off of a Top 4 finish at the 2023 World Championships, Azul is one of the strongest players this game has ever seen, and we are actively watching him continue to grow as one of the best players of all time!</p>

                <div class='image-and-text'>
                    <img src='../../assets/article-images/azul.jpg'>
                    <div class='column-text'>
                        <p>I know that this choice may already turn some of you retro heads away, given that most of his accomplishments are more recent, but hear me out. Azul has been playing the game for more than thirteen years and has not only made a name for himself as one of, if not <i>the</i>, top content creators in the game. But he won the very first Regionals he attended in 2010! He was destined to be a Champion from the beginning.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>It took a few years afterwards for Azul to find his stride, but once he did, he has only continued to snowball into what I think, is the 5th best player in the game's history.</p>
                <p>Let's take a look at just <i style='text-decoration:underline;'>some</i> of Azul's most notable accomplishments:</p>
                <img src='../../assets/article-images/yellow-black-azul.png'>
                <p>Again, that's just some of Azul's accomplishments... too many to add to the graphic above, absolutely insane.</p>
                <p>He is most known as a two-time International Champion and five-time Regional Champion (the third most "winning-est" Regional Champion in history). But as you can see above, he made finals at another Internationals event and finals of three other Regionals. Only two other players have also won two Internationals each respectively, <i>Gustavo Wada</i> and <i>Stéphane Ivanoff</i>, and like Azul, <i>Stéphane</i> also made finals at a third Internationals. (Obviously not counting <i>Tord Reklev</i>, but trust me, we'll get to him later.) Now, both could be argued by many to have more accolades than Azul, like Gustavo winning the 2010 World Championships in the Senior Division. But, it's hard to ignore the amount of Regionals Azul has taken down in the US. Unfortunately for both <i>Gustavo</i> and <i>Stéphane</i>, the EU and LATAM regions have never had as many Regionals nor Special Events as in the US, esspecially LATAM. If so, it's quite possible that either would have more Regional/SPE titles on their records. But this is not a what-if list based on geography.</p>
                <p>Prior to this year's World Championships, while close, I honestly don't think Azul would have been on my top 5 list. But after his Top 4 finish in Yokohama, and only having been just a knock out away from making finals, Azul is who I believe, to be the 5th best player in the history of Pokémon! And trust me when I say that we have not seen the last of him yet.</p>

                <!-- 4 -->
                <div class='align-row'>
                    <h3>4. Igor Costa</h3>&nbsp;
                    <a class='twit-link' href='https://twitter.com/IgorDolbeth?s=20' target="_blank">@IgorDolbeth</a>
                </div>
                <p>Igor has more or less stepped away from the game in the last few years, but him having stopped traveling to events outside of New England does not take him out of consideration as one of the greatest players in the history of the game.</p>
                <div class='image-and-text'>
                    <img src='../../assets/article-images/igor.jpg'>
                    <div class='column-text'>
                        <p>Before we look at his accomplishments, what if I told you that Igor made Top 4 at not one, not two, but three Worlds, AND nearly back to back... to back! That's almost as hard to believe as <i>Jason Klaczynski</i> having won three Worlds... but obviously not at all on the same level.</p>
                        <p>Igor is also one of very few players who have moved to the US from his own country of Portugal. Meaning his accomplishments spanned different countries throughout the years. Which is really cool to think about.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Let's take a look at some of Igor's most well-known accomplishments:</p>
