                <p>What does it mean to have a ‘healthy’ format? What does it take for a card to be ‘toxic’ enough to threaten that health? Due to one of the most infamous cards in the modern era of the Pokémon Trading Card Game, the Sun & Moon through Lost Thunder format is polarizing, to say the least. Many within the competitive and retro communities respectively regard SUM-LOT as one of the greatest modern eras, while others have nothing but disdain for it. Using this format as a case study, we’ll examine the debate over what makes a meta ‘healthy’ or not, discuss the makings of toxic cards, and seek to answer the question of why SUM-LOT remains so controversial. Let’s dive in!
                </p>

                <h3>Introduction to Sun & Moon to Lost Thunder</h3>
                <hr class='title-hr'>

                <p>Lost Thunder was released in English on November 2nd, 2018 as the eighth expansion in the Sun & Moon block. The set contained a mind-blowing 236 cards in total, including thirteen GX cards in various rarities, and seven new Prism Star cards. With such a wealth of new cards introduced into the deck building pool, it came as no surprise that so many of them turned out to be competitively viable at one point or another.</p>

                <p>Eleven major tournaments took place in this format, ranging from the <a href='major-events/2019/laic/summary'>Latin American International Championships</a> in November of 2018, to the Peru Special Event in February of 2019. Three Regionals were held in the SUM-LOT era, one in the United States, one in Australia, and another in the UK.</p>

                <p>The competitive landscape was dramatically altered by the release of Lost Thunder, with the introduction of several new top-tier archetypes, techs, and even an entirely new deck building engine. Of the thirteen new GX cards introduced with this set, a whopping ten of them saw at least fringe play, either as their own archetypes or as techs in others – though some not until later formats. Lost Thunder also gave us Prism Star Stadiums for the first time, one of which saw widespread and immediate success.</p>

                <p>Let’s take a look at some of the top cards from Lost Thunder, based on competitive usage at the time of the set’s release:</p>

                <h3>Ditto Prism Star:</h3>
                <br>
                <div class='image-and-text'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week zoomed' src='../../assets/cards/2018-17/ditto-p.png' alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                    <div class='column-text'>
                        <p>This card became an instant inclusion in nearly every evolution-based deck due to its ‘Almighty Evolution’ Ability, which allowed for incredible versatility in deckbuilding. It could function as an effective ‘fifth’ basic in decks like Zoroark and Malamar, give more consistency to decks with many different evolving lines like Gardevoir or Granbull, and even allow you to play zero copies of a basic, relying solely on Ditto as was the case with Alolan Muk. This card was a staple of any evolving deck throughout the entirety of its Standard legality.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <br>
                <h3>Professor Elm’s Lecture:</h3>
                <br>
                <div class='image-and-text'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week zoomed' src='../../assets/cards/2018-17/elms-lecture.png' alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                    <div class='column-text'>
                        <p>Elm allowed you to search your deck for up to three Pokémon with 60 or less HP and add them to your hand. Many decks like Gardevoir and Zoroark relied greatly on this card, often running the full four copies in a deck. Throughout the Sun & Moon-on block, many of these turn one setup Supporters were included in decks to benefit from Tapu Lele GX’s ‘Wonder Tag’ Ability, allowing for a Supporter to be searched from your deck. Unlike in the current Standard format rules, Supporters could be played on your first turn during this time, and as such, setup cards like Elm were invaluable in establishing your board.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <br>
                <h3>Blacephalon GX:</h3>
                <br>
                <div class='image-and-text'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week zoomed' src='../../assets/cards/2018-17/blacephalon-gx.png' alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                    <div class='column-text'>
                        <p>The Ultra Beast mechanic in the Pokémon TCG reached new heights with Blacephalon-GX. Affectionately named “Blowns,” the Blacephalon deck took advantage of Forbidden Light’s Beast Ring Item, and the newly released Naganadel’s ‘Charging Up’ Ability to flood the board with Fire Energy to be sent to the Lost Zone for Blacephalon’s “Mind Blown” attack. A hot pick at tournaments throughout its legality, Blacephalon was easily the most popular entirely new archetype to be introduced from Lost Thunder.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <br>
                <h3>Naganadel:</h3>
                <br>
                <div class='image-and-text'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week zoomed' src='../../assets/cards/2019-2020/naganadel.png' alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                    <div class='column-text'>
                        <p>While Naganadel was a natural fit for the Blacephalon deck, it also inspired another deck that inspired a near-cult following: NagQuag. Utilizing the ‘Charging Up’ Ability of Naganadel to accelerate Energy from your Discard Pile, Quagsire from Dragon Majesty would then use its ‘Wash Out’ Ability to move all Water Energy to an Active attacker of choice. The deck was never considered “top tier,” however it was always a popular choice for smaller local events like League Challenges and League Cups, and remains a format favorite.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <br>
                <h3>Granbull:</h3>
                <br>
                <div class='image-and-text'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week zoomed' src='../../assets/cards/2018-17/granbull.png' alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                    <div class='column-text'>
                        <p>One of the most notoriously challenging decks to pilot, Granbull relied on playing with a zero card hand to activate the bonus damage of the “All Out” attack. When adding in cards like Shrine of Punishment and Choice Band to supply additional damage, Granbull was a powerhouse single-prizer with tremendous potential. The engine of the deck used Celestial Storm’s Magcargo with its ‘Smooth Over’ Ability in conjunction with Oranguru from Sun & Moon’s ‘Instruct’ to manipulate your hand and top-deck to facilitate playing with an empty hand. With its high damage output and favorable prize trade against the heavy two-prize meta, Granbull was another popular brand new archetype from the Lost Thunder expansion.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <br>
                <h3>Alolan Ninetales GX:</h3>
                <br>
                <div class='image-and-text'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week zoomed' src='../../assets/cards/2018-17/ninetales-gx-fairy.png' alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                    <div class='column-text'>
                        <p>While Alolan Ninetales GX never had a deck of its own, the card quickly saw play as an engine that enabled many new archetypes to exist, and also breathed life into older ones. Pre-existing decks like Buzzwole GX took advantage of the ‘Mysterious Guidance’ Ability to search out valuable Items like Beast Ring, while some Stage 2-centric decks like Gardevoir and Zoroark/Decidueye relied on this Ability to consistently find Rare Candy. Many decks, like the two just mentioned, were also able to utilize Ninetales as an attacker. Its “Snowy Wind” attack could set up some key damage, dealing 70 to the Active and 30 to a Benched Pokémon, while the “Sublimation GX” attack was able to instantly knock out an opposing Ultra Beast Pokémon, of which there were many in the field. Much of the Sun & Moon to Lost Thunder format was dominated by this new Alolan Ninetales GX engine.</p>

                <h3>Major Players: The Decks of Sun & Moon to Lost Thunder</h3>
                <hr class='title-hr'>

                <h4><i>The Old Guard: Gardevoir’s Second Coming</i></h4>
<br>
                <p>Let’s get one thing straight. Gardevoir GX, a deck that saw immediate success upon its release in the Burning Shadows expansion, going on to win the <a href='../../worlds/2017/summary'>2017 World Championships</a> in the Masters division, was never quite dead. With Sun & Moon base and the introduction of GX cards as Stage 1 and Stage 2 Pokémon instead of the dreaded "Big Basics" of the EX-era, (not to be confused with the lowercase ex-era), cards like Gardevoir GX relied heavily on the relative speed of the surrounding metagame to find their success. Despite the card itself being an undisputed powerhouse, the challenges of being a Stage 2 Pokémon that required either two turns of evolution, or finding timely combo pieces like Rare Candy, had seen Gardevoir fade in competitive relevance. Though Gardy found some success partnered with Zoroark GX prior to the <a href='../../worlds/2018/summary'>2018 World Championships</a>, Buzzwole GX and other aggressive Basic or Stage 1 decks could now simply outclass the slower Stage 2 Pokémon.</p>

                <div class='image-and-text'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week zoomed' src='../../assets/cards/2018-17/gardevoir-gx.png' alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                </div>
                
                <p>That all changed with the release of Lost Thunder and Alolan Ninetales-GX however. As previously mentioned, Alolan Ninetales introduced itself as a brand new engine for many different decks, but none had such a natural fit as alongside Gardevoir. Builds of old traditionally included Alolan Vulpix (GRI) solely for its ‘Beacon’ attack, which cost zero energy and allowed you to search for two Pokémon from your deck, and wouldn’t you know, guess what Alolan Vulpix evolves into? Ninetales, and its ‘Mysterious Guidance’ Ability, had seemingly solved the age-old problem with Stage 2 decks: consistency. But the Fairy type GX Pokémon wasn’t just a support card in this deck. Equipped with two decent attacks in “Snowy Wind” and “Sublimation GX,” and paired with Gardevoir’s ‘Secret Spring’ Ability allowing for energy acceleration, Ninetales was suddenly transformed into an effective secondary attacker, too.</p>
