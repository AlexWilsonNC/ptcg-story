                <p><i>~ Lead your Team to victory! ~</i> That’s what the back of the Team Magma and Team Aqua booster
                    pack says anyway. Salutations! Sean Adam here, with heavy tonnage on the 2004 format. This is the
                    secret format everyone loves, but no one is particularly loud about! A format with EXPLOUD and no
                    one is SCREAMING how interesting and creative this format can be. Not only does it make a good
                    competitive format with a diverse cardpool for simple play, there are tons of gauntlet decks
                    available. I hear, gauntlets are a big deal in the retro community to keep matches less competitive
                    and more about expression. I don’t really get it, but I love talking about Pokémon for an abnormal
                    amount of time, so here we go!</p>

                <br>
                <p>With the upcoming online retro tournament I'm hosting this Saturday, <i>"The War of 04"</i>, I wanted
                    to talk about the format in hopes of helping those interested in the event, or the format in
                    general. With four irl Booster Boxes in prizing & more, there's still time to sign up for this
                    exciting event! <a href='https://play.limitlesstcg.com/tournament/6505bdb7ef170f0f1b0dea37/details'
                        target="_blank">Event info & registration here</a>.</p>
                <p>We'll also be streaming the event <a href='https://www.twitch.tv/thewarof04' target="_blank">here</a>
                    if you'd like to watch!</p>

                <hr class='title-hr'>

                <p>The 2004 format is commonly referred to in its <a href='../../worlds/2004/summary'>World
                        Championship’s</a> rendition, with cards from <a
                        href='../../decks-by-era/2004/expedit-hidleg'>Expedition to Hidden Legends</a>. The big feature
                    was the new two-prize Pokémon, Pokémon-ex, basically meaning “extra power.” The card design of
                    Pokémon-ex typically followed as such:</p>

                <ul style='font-style: italic;'>
                    <li style='margin-bottom: 5px;'>Much more HP than Pokémon of the equivalent "Stage"</li>
                    <li style='margin-bottom: 5px;'>Pokémon-ex typically has the power to take 2 Prize Cards before
                        being Knocked Out against 1 Prize Pokémon.</li>
                    <li style='margin-bottom: 5px;'>The first Attack’s Energy cost on a Pokémon-ex was low, but their
                        second attack, (and even in some cases, the next three Attacks), had much higher costs. However,
                        most attacks always have an additional effect, making them stronger than the average non-ex
                        attack.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <p>In 2004, the average damage output of any Stage of Pokémon was 3 Energy for an attack that dealt 50,
                    typically having an additional effect, whether conditional or applied. (Look at Blaziken, Grumpig,
                    and Registeel-ex.)</p>

                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week-mid-multi old-card zoomed'
                        src='../../assets/cards/2004-2006/blaziken.jpg' alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                    <img class='card-of-the-week-mid-multi radius-card zoomed'
                        src='../../assets/cards/2004-2006/dr.006.grumpig.jpg' alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                    <img class='card-of-the-week-mid-multi radius-card zoomed'
                        src='../../assets/cards/2004-2006/hl.099.registeel_ex.jpg' alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                </div>

                <p>Even most Basic Pokémon-ex don’t break this rule. Typically, if a Pokémon has a Poké-Body or
                    Poké-Power, it will lack an additional attack, and have an additional retreat cost. Retreat Cost is
                    typically associated with the HP or Attacks and other effects they carry. So, these three Pokémon
                    are very good at determining the value of cards, which is important because the e-card era brought
                    in crazy amounts of cards into the pool!</p>

                <p>It’s good to go over a few details about the format and the article before we dive into cards. Can
                    you remember the strategies and rules for this format? I sure can’t half the time, but that’s okay!
                    Here's some key information so that you don’t have to worry!</p>

                <p>- There is a severe lack of Bench protection in this format, so you will need to be wary of damage
                    ticking up across your board.</p>

                <p>- The format is slow for a few turns, but then speeds up and solely relies on the player knowing how
                    to sequence plays and strategize several turns in advance.</p>

                <p>-This article is covering post-Worlds material from my personal experience with the format and
                    compares it to more modern styles of play and more optimized decklists.</p>

                <p>- While some things may be referenced in the article, this write-up will not be covering heavy
                    historical context for the format outside of the cards and the rules of the format.</p>

                <p>- Players flip a coin to determine who goes first, and whoever wins the flip must go first. Games are
                    intended to be played in a best of 1 match, and a round timer of 30 minutes. I found it important to
                    include this because it may help some understand why a decklist is built the way it is. </p>

                <p>These three were introduced as late as the second to last set of the format, which then further set
                    the precedent for even stronger Pokémon-ex. You know what else is crazy? Every Pokémon currently
                    listed in this article is good in the format! We will be discussing the more competitive angle, so
                    prepare for a crash course on deck-building and making cards work for you!</p>

                <h3><i>Dunsparce is King of the Format</i></h3><br>

                <p>It’s no exaggeration that this lil’ guy is Striking and simply Running! He’s absolutely getting away
                    with being the best Pokémon in the format! Second being Torchic and third being Copycat. Strike and
                    Run grabs three Basic Pokémon from deck to Bench, with the added bonus of being able to switch out
                    of Dunsparce. The one thing any 2004 player will tell you is “I lost to Sudden Flash flipping
                    heads,” which brings up a glaring flaw in people’s perception of the 2004 format, more on that
                    later. Dunsparce is basically mandatory for your deck. Delcatty? Yes. Magneton? Yes! Bellossom tech?
                    You want those cards OUT of your deck to progress because 2004 is known as a chill format; games are
                    kind of slow, but strategy prevails in the end.</p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week-mid-multi old-card zoomed'
                        src='../../assets/cards/2004-2006/ss.060.dunsparce.jpg' alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                </div>

                <h3><i>Set-Up is Key</i></h3><br>

                <p>You will need to dig through your deck fast if you want to compete with any deck in the format at a
                    reasonable pace. Decks that don’t run Delcatty and Magneton (the "Magnecat Engine") usually have
                    more value with their specific Pokémon to be less dependent on draw. An example would be an
                    aggressive Stage 1 deck that can take Knock Outs quickly. That being said, if you are running a
                    Stage 2, you most likely need Magnecat.</p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week-mid-multi old-card zoomed'
                        src='../../assets/cards/2004-2006/rs.005.delcatty.jpg' alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                    <img class='card-of-the-week-mid-multi radius-card zoomed'
                        src='../../assets/cards/2004-2006/dr.017.magneton.jpg' alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                    <img class='card-of-the-week-mid-multi radius-card zoomed'
                        src='../../assets/cards/2004-2006/dr.088.tv_reporter.jpg' alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                </div>

                <p>Magnetic Field, TV Reporter, and Delcatty are only three ways to reliably discard cards from your
                    hand in this format! As stated before, games will be slow and then stabilize into combat puzzles.
                    You will be stuck with cards in hand without Magneton, which acts as a good attacker too. What’s
                    really good about the design in this series is that few Pokémon are boring, meaning most Pokémon
                    have many additional applications during play. Magnecat’s diverse engine structure and Energy cost
                    can fit in just about any deck, so it’s much harder to not justify playing it. If you are not
                    playing Magnecat, you will need to run TV Reporter to remove dead weight from your hands. There are
                    still ways to build decks without these cards, but they will be at a significant disadvantage unless
                    the Pokemon exceeds the value.</p>

                <p id='supporters'>The search in this format is limited, but works for the format. See, since Magnecat
                    is such a
                    dominant draw engine in many decks, Friend Ball acts as a free Skitty, Delcatty, or Dunsparce so
                    long as your opponent also plays Dunsparce. It allows Exploud to have 4 search cards that require no
                    real drawback so long as a Dunsparce or Delcatty is present. Almost any deck that runs Delcatty
                    should consider Friend Ball, but does it conquer the other search in the format?</p>

                <p>Here's a great example of a deck utilizing the above engine to the fullest.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Oracle is a key card in Magnecat engines, similar to the previous format’s Oracle into Bill to
                    immediately draw the cards searched. Most Oracle stacks will look like either a Rare Candy and their
                    Evolution, or Steven’s Advice into their Evolution. It is almost always best to slowly evolve your
                    Pokémon over time. Rare Candy in this era allowed a Stage 2 Pokémon to be in play as early as turn
                    1, but most evolved Pokémon lack an attack that costs 1 Energy. In most formats, if you draw-pass,
                    and your opponent misses a key play, you have 1 turn to come back. In 2004, it’s about 2 or more.
                    It’s hard to guarantee a Rare Candy without Oracle, as the best Trainer search we have in the format
                    is Traveling Salesman and Relic Hunter. </p>

                <p>Oracle has very strong staying power, as even when games are stalled by Sudden Flash, Oracle forces
                    your opponent to respond in turn. It’s easy to get steamrolled if you can’t pilot your Oracle turns
                    properly.</p>

                <p>Professor Elm’s Training Method isn’t a good four-of, meaning unlike Celio’s Network, the card will
                    have low value comparatively to Oracle and Friend Ball. However, its application is still very
                    useful, acting as an additional search card for your Evolution. This is important as most games will
                    likely drop a Town Volunteers.</p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week-mid-multi old-card zoomed'

                </div>

                <p>Town Volunteers is a staple in the format as a one-of, but some decks should consider running more.
                    Sceptile, Blaziken, and Exploud are decks that should consistently get back their energy. Swampert
                    typically utilizes Magneton, so there would be no real point in having more than one in that
                    archetype. Late game, Town Volunteers can almost always follow-up with an Elm into their recycled
                    attacker, Rare Candy, accelerate, and attack; the other instance is using Oracle over Elm, but the
                    point being, Elm’s highest value is towards the end of the game in this format, as you’ve likely
                    used your Oracle cards to set up.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Copycat and Steven’s Advice are practically four-of's in every deck, each. Hand Size is a critical
                    resource in this format, which is one of its more unique traits. In Base-Fossil, your opponent can
                    have 20-card hands and the game can be in a stalemate... But in 2004, you do not have that kind of
                    time. By turn three or four, the first knock-out will occur, and I’m not kidding when I say it turns
                    into a combat puzzle. The reason hand size is important, is these conditional Supporters that are
                    played in every deck. </p>

                <p><i><strong>Note:</strong> Steven’s Advice was played using its mistranslation for a long time. It
                        received an errata eventually to match the properly translated Japanese text. The card

                <hr><br>
                <p>Combine many conditional Supporters with a lack of splashable discard effects, these cards become
                    incredibly easy to deny or hinder. The nature of Delcatty and Magneton already add cards to your
                    hand, meaning Copycat becomes more potent. If you’re able to deny a bigger Copycat hand going into
                    your opponent’s turn, you should try your best to keep your hand around 4-7 cards in the early half
                    of the game.</p>

                <p>It’s also interesting to note that holding Steven’s Advice isn’t a bad play. Dunsparce uses Strike
                    and Run twice almost every game, so why draw four when you could wait for six? Oracle stacking
                    Steven’s Advice and Delcatty/Friend Ball are great plays, and even TV Reporter can fill that role
                    too. </p>

                <p>Towards the late game, it’s important to keep your hand size large. It’s very easy to lose track of
                    Delcatty draws, only to find out your hand size is six after playing it out, your deck count is nine
                    and your opponent’s hand is seventeen cards. While playing Copycat will get more cards, you will
                    deck out the following turn! </p>

                <p>Desert Shaman on the surface looks like Judge, but has the same trick as Rocket’s Admin where you can
                    choose to draw less than 4 cards. There aren’t many applications where it’s relevant, but it’s
                    important to note because who knows? Maybe it will stop you from decking out. Desert Shaman is a
                    good card if your opponent doesn’t have a Delcatty setup, typically reserved as a low priority
                    one-of. Decks like Blaziken prefer to include it as their mirror match-up is 50/50, and shuffling
                    away key cards is always good. Oracle is a good countermeasure to Desert Shaman as well, but it
                    should be noted Shaman is not a very useful supporter in the format, except maybe for one deck. If
                    your opponent is out of Oracle, Desert Shaman becomes a much stronger card. No one wants to energy
                    draw blindly!</p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week-mid-multi old-card zoomed'

                </div>

                <p>From Dunsparce to Desert Shaman, you now have seen the core of Supporter cards played in this era, so
                    let’s cover some other Trainers.</p>

                <hr class='title-hr' id='trainers'>

                <h3><i>Flip the Table</i></h3><br>

                <p>Despite this format being slow, Energy Removal 2 isn’t really that great of a card. It’s very good
                    against decks that lack any sort of acceleration, but the slow pace means the card doesn’t have high
                    value throughout the game. Dual Ball can act as a Dunsparce replacement, reserved for decks that
                    don’t run enough basics to justify Dunsparce.</p>

                <p>The thing I love about Lure Ball is the abnormal centering of the card effect (It’s the same even for
                    the Japanese print). Lure Ball has high potential in decks that can’t afford to run Town Volunteers,
                    but run 4-of basics. Decks like Gorebyss and Medicham variants tend to run 4-3 and 3-3s. Rather than
                    digging for the next Evolution, or worse, ripping your Fast Ball and drawing the wrong topper, you
                    have very good odds of getting it out of discard using Lure Ball. The only problem with Lure Ball is
                    you can’t really justify more than 1, so it’s likely just a bad card. I would love to see someone
                    utilize it. Jake Gearheart used it in <a
                        href='https://play.limitlesstcg.com/tournament/606ea5cc8a46bf0b3b0a691e/standings'
                        target="_blank">Jay Hornung's Tournament</a> exactly the way I’ve been describing it.</p>

                <p>Quickly now, we follow with Fast Ball. The card is incredibly good, especially when paired with a
                    certain Stadium card. Fast Ball is good in decks that lack Oracle or Elm’s Training Method, but will
                    run into issues if you run more than two evolutionary lines. A good combo-play is using Oracle to
                    grab your Evolution, then Fast Ball it immediately into your hand. Why is that good? Well, if you
                    must Oracle to get Delcatty, you get it 1 turn faster. While Friend Ball usually takes its place,
                    some decks don’t run Colorless Pokémon.</p>

                </div>

                <p>There is a player in my area who attends my monthly cube sessions. He started when Unbroken Bonds
                    released, and continues to question why Master Ball and Master Ball <i>ACE SPEC</i> are different,
                    and why Great Ball now uses Master Ball's original effect. The easiest answer is that Pokémon is not
                    consistent with its cardpool. Master Ball is only good if you are running thick lines of Evolutions,
                    such as 4-3-4s compared to the support lines of 3-2-3 or higher. If you are running many different
                    Pokémon, it has higher value. However, this is usually reserved to decks that can’t run the Magnecat
                    engine.</p>

                <p>This format is the only format where Fire doesn’t always lose to Water simply from Weakness, because
                    Resistance is an incredibly strong boon to have in this format. Common resistances are Water,
                    Psychic, and Fighting, and in this generation the max rate is -30 damage upon attack. Combine that
                    with the average 50 damage output, and you are going nowhere. Crystal Shard makes your Pokémon a
                    Colorless type until the end of turn, which is almost mandatory for decks that have these known
                    Resistances. </p>

                <h3><i>The Relic Hunter Engine</i></h3><br>

                <p>Relic Hunter is a very good card that has a hard time finding its place in a Magnecat world. Because
                    of oppression, Relic Hunter can’t be played on the first turn unlike the previous format. The key to
                    Relic Hunter being good is the ability to grab Stadium cards and search out supporters that aren’t
                    4-ofs. Let’s talk about it a little bit, as it’s not a common engine. Relic Hunter works in decks
                    that run few basics, or need ways to bump Stadiums quickly without wasting an Oracle. I’ve always
                    wanted to test out Relic Hunter in Crobat since Flutter Trick is very disruptive combined with
                    Desert Shaman, AND you won’t allow your opponent to Copycat a huge hand after because Relic Hunter
                    is grabbing 2 cards as opposed to Steven's Advice drawing you 6.</p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week-mid-multi old-card zoomed'

                </div>

                <p>Professor Oak’s Research gets the short end of the stick a lot of the time, and it definitely has a
                    use when you don’t want to drop a Steven’s Advice or Copycat, and you don’t want to give your
                    opponent’s Copycat high value. Apricorn Maker doesn’t really justify a 4-of because you can’t play
                    it on the first turn, but take decks like Muk-ex that don’t run a lot of basics. All you need in
                    that deck is 1 Apricorn Maker to grab Fast and Dual Ball, or 2 Dual Ball. Since you’re already
                    shutting off Poké-Powers and Poké-Bodies, you have time to Relic Hunter for the supporters you need.

                <p>Softer mentions would be Pokémon Fan Club and Lanette’s Net Search. If there was a Holon’s Castform
                    in the format, Lanette’s would be an insanely powerful card. Dunsparce invalidates the majority of
                    Basic Search naturally from the turn 1 rules, but if you absolutely hate Dunsparce and Dual Ball,
                    these work for the Relic Hunter engine.</p>

                <p>Traveling Salesman doesn’t have a lot of good targets, however, the Tools in this format are diverse.
                    Here are some highlights, especially Balloon Berry as a searchable Switch.</p>

                <p>Switching in and out of Active is very important, and you should try to fit in a Warp Point in all of
                    your decks. While not necessary, the card acts as Gust of Wind in several settings. Decks like
                    Blaziken who repeatedly chain attacks need ways to constantly pivot their attackers out of active.
                    Towards the end of the game, Warp Point is especially deadly.</p>

                <h3><i>Warp Point is Gust of Wind</i></h3><br>

                <p>Bench Space is more important than even Hand Size in this format because of cards like Warp Point. If
                    you blaze through all your Rare Candy in the first half of the game, you will stutter in the second
                    half when your lines of play are Town Volunteers to recycle attackers. Towards 3-4 prize games,
                    using Warp Point forces your opponent to choose losing a Basic or a Key Attacker in many cases. For
                    Blaziken, you want to consistently recycle Volcanic Ash on your Blaziken-ex. Warp Point functions as
                    a Switch in this deck because Volcanic Ash doesn’t need to attack the Active Pokémon, and being able
                    to take out Basics is very good. Isn’t it interesting how simply designing the attacks to deal 50
                    damage on average, combined with most evolving basics having 50 HP, that Warp Point becomes a more
                    dangerous card? Its meanest application? Did your opponent start with Dunsparce and bench a Pokémon?
                    Yoink! Now they better have a switch out to use it, which is always a waste.</p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>

                </div>

                <p>So, when is it correct to run Pokémon Reversal? Warp Point can’t grab exactly what you want.
                    Aggressive decks that can deal 50 very quickly (Team Magma, Gorebyss, Medicham) should consider this
                    card to take quick prizes. Remember! This format is played Best of 1, 30 minutes, and the player who
                    has taken the most prizes wins the game! Aggressive decks tend to run out of gas as soon as a
                    Swampert or Blaziken is swinging for 100. Kicking Basics is typically what you aim for in the early
                    game.</p>

                <h3><i>Is Juggler good?</i></h3><br>

                <p> Here’s a easy to follow guide to see if you should play Juggler in your deck:</p>

                <p><strong><i>Are you playing Mewtwo-ex? If yes, than yes. If not, than no...</i></strong></p>

                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Essentially, no, Juggler is not a worth-while card.
                    <strong>Reasoning:</strong> Steven’s Advice draws 6 cards. Delcatty is basically Juggler. If you are
                    considering Juggler, consider using its 4 copies to put 2 Skitty and 2 Delcatty in your deck
                    instead.
                </p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week-mid-multi old-card zoomed'
                        src='../../assets/cards/e-reader/juggler.jpg' alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                </div>

                <p>I always want to call Underground Expedition bait, but it becomes incredibly good when your deck is
                    thin. You can easily search out 2 cards you need after a Town Volunteers after so many Delcatty
                    draws. That being said, I don’t think it’s better than TV Reporter in Blaziken, but great in decks
                    that don’t want to lose cards. Its highest value is if the deck playing runs many 4-ofs.</p>

                <p>Mr. Briney’s Compassion and Pokémon Nurse break boundaries when it comes to Supporter Power. In
                    theory, Briney as a 4-of is too good to ignore, but that is only card theory. You cannot pick up
                    Pokémon-ex, but it acts as a Switch and a Pokémon Nurse at the same time. Rare Candy can be used
                    immediately in this format, and picking up a Swampert after using Water Call, then Candy to use it
                    again could be the difference between defeat and victory.</p>

                <p>Pokémon Nurse is the opposite of Briney, but is useful because it doesn’t restrict against
                    Pokémon-ex. With several accelerators and overall bulky Pokémon, Sceptile-ex and Blaziken-ex just
                    LOVE to get 150 HP back, and don’t really have issues getting the energy back thanks to their
                    synergy with 1-Prize toppers. The only problem is, these cards are absolutely dead weight in your
                    hand until you’ve completely set up. Reducing them to 2 copies is usually best, and most Stage 2
                    focused decks will split 1-1.</p>

                <hr class='title-hr' id='stadiums'>
                <h3><i>Set the Stage</i></h3><br>

                <p>I am always envious of other formats that have better Stadium card design, but I’ve discovered that
                    while the Stadiums aren’t particularly interesting or gamebreaking, have niche uses that stop you
                    from having an off turn.</p>

                <p>Desert Ruins without a doubt is the best Stadium card in the format. Again, the average damage output
                    in this format is 50 damage, and most viable Pokémon-ex have well over 100 HP. You need to soften
                    them up to turn three-hit knock-outs into quicker two-hit KOs. </p>
                <p>Since it’s relevant, I’ll go ahead and talk about Desert Ruin’s worst enemy. Bellossom - which resets
                    the Stadium’s damage each turn, but it isn’t a perfect counter. It isn’t necessary to run Bellossom
                    in every deck. Decks like Gardevoir want it because of Psyshadow’s after-effect. It’s hard to
                    justify space sometimes. The best application to decide on it is if you are running Pokémon-ex, if
                    one of your attackers has Water/Fighting/Psychic Resistance, Bellossom improves the matchup
                    significantly</p>

                </div>

                <p>Low and High Pressure Systems have use in many decks. Low Pressure System isn’t that good, as 10 HP
                    isn’t going to change much, but is a good check to Ancient Technical Machine [Rock]. High Pressure
                    System has some crazy value considering Warp Point and Warp Energy. </p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>

                </div>

                <p>Let’s do some applied learning. Say you have no Team Aqua’s Manectric, and you absolutely need to
                    obliterate a Delcatty on your opponent’s bench with Volcanic Ash to even the board. We only need 3
                    cards for this play, while preserving our Warp Points and Pokémon Nurses.</p>

                <ol style='margin-left: 25px;'>
                    <li style='margin-bottom: 5px;'>Bench a Torchic/Mudkip (Just needs to be a 1 Retreat Cost Fire/Water
                        Pokémon).</li>
                    <li style='margin-bottom: 5px;'>Attach Warp Energy to your Active Blaziken-ex.</li>
                    <li style='margin-bottom: 5px;'>Play High Pressure System.</li>
                    <li style='margin-bottom: 5px;'>Value!</li>
                </ol>
                <br>

                <p>If you’re still kind of stuck, you retreat out of that basic. Make sure you know what your
                    accelerators are sticking the energy to before you decide to retreat.
                </p>

                <p>Ancient Tomb finds its use when your attackers share common metagame weaknesses, Fighting being the
                    most relevant, and Psychic most likely the second. The only issue is Ancient Tomb doesn’t affect
                    Pokémon-ex, which makes its deck slot hard to justify. Exploud can run it to handle Magma matchups,
                    but those spots are reserved for Desert Ruins. Machamp loves this card, as well as the following
                    card below. You can’t tech for everything in this metagame, so it’s best to solidify the matchups
                    you can win.

                </div>

                <p> If you are playing a Psychic Pokémon that isn’t Gardevoir or Banette, you probably want Magnetic
                    Storm. If you are playing a Fighting type that isn’t Team Magma’s Groudon, you probably want
                    Magnetic Storm. Gardevoir-ex doesn’t really need Magnetic Storm, Psystorm is just that powerful.
                    When is it useful? If your Fighting or Psychic deck fails to 2-hit KO a Pokemon because of
                    Resistance, here you go!
                </p>

                <p>Mystery Zone or Island Cave in Swampert? Being able to Fast Ball and get an Energy card from the
                    searched Pokémon is very good. However, I believe that Island Cave serves more purpose overall than
                    Mystery Zone. Mystery Zone’s boon comes from not being reliant on Magneton to get Energy, but you’ll
                    be playing that anyway. Decks like Wailord and Walrein want Island Cave in their decks because it’s
                    sure annoying when Bellossom Miracle Powder’s you and follows up with Solarbeam. Regardless, I don’t
                    find either of these cards carrying games. If you’re playing the tier 5 favorite, Regirock-ex, or
                    the aforementioned tier 6 deck, Registeel-ex, then Island Cave is great!

                </div>

                <p> Mirage Stadium and Team Aqua’s Hideout function as good stalling techniques. If your opponent has a
                    low hand size, Mirage Stadium forces the Switch cards out early or forces your opponent to rely on
                    variance, or worse, wasting an Oracle stack to grab a counter-Stadium card just to avoid the
                    variance. I’m surprised this card isn’t played more today, as I think splitting it up with Team Aqua
                    Hideout is good in decks like Muk-ex. Mirage Stadium doesn’t have high value when hands are large
                    and switch cards are in abundance. Unless you’re playing decks that slow games down, it isn’t going
                    to have high value.

                <h3 id='stones'><i>Back to the Stone Ages!</i></h3><br>

                <p>One time I was playing <a href='https://twitter.com/MReynolds_1337' target="_blank">Mike Reynolds</a>
                    in 2006, and he attached Ancient Technical Machine [Rock] to devolve all of my Raichu and Exeggutor,
                    typing in all caps, “BACK TO THE STONE AGES!” The worst part? He wasn’t playing RockLock or anything
                    (He was playing Arcanine-ex <i>(Houndoom)</i> and set me up). I’ll never forget it, because I
                    thought that card was only really good in this format!</p>

                <p>Ancient Technical Machine [Rock], is by far, one of the strongest cards in the format and is believed
                    to be a 1-of in every deck that has an Evolved Pokémon as its primary attacking line. Why? So many
                    lines of play with this card! It fundamentally acts as a Gorebyss check, since Double Rainbow are
                    discarded between turns if it isn’t attached to an Evolved Pokémon that isn’t a Pokémon-ex; In
                    Blaziken, you can find yourself winning games without Volcanic Ash by nature of Firestream; Even in
                    early stages of the game, it can act as counter-play to aggressive Rare Candy plays. This is without
                    a doubt one of the greatest cards ever printed.</p>

                <h3><i>An Expedition into Unknown Territory</i></h3><br>

                <p> Retro formats seem to be considered like timepieces by a lot of people, and forget that these can be
                    played forever and change forever. Of course, formats will always find a stagnation point where
                    decks have confirmed matchup spreads and optimized decklists. 2004 is no exception, only there are
                    many ways to play each deck with different cards. Let’s highlight some Pokémon cards that showed up
                    post-worlds, in which hopefully help you brainstorm ideas.</p>

                <h3>Ditto (Skyridge 51)</h3><br>

                <p>For many years, I questioned what that Pokémon next to the Doduo was supposed to be (Stantler? Where
                    are the antlers?). For an eon, I pondered why Ditto didn’t show up in ANY worlds lists. If there was
                    ever a deterrent to old format and lists, it was because cards were not readily available, and games
                    stores didn’t really exist in abundance. Ebay was your best bet, right next to flea markets, but
                    many had already exited the Pokémon scene in this era. I think every older player in these eras can
                    always lead to obvious cards not being played as “Information wasn’t readily available.” E-Card was
                    notorious for being a poorly received set by players for simplifying the game and games being much
                    slower with added restrictions, and E-Readers were not a successful gimmick. Did you know that
                    E-Readers give E-Card Pokémon special attacks that you can only use if you have an E-Reader? You can
                    do this if you want, you just need an E-Reader (impossible) and happen to find someone willing to
                    turn 50 years older playing E-Card with you.</p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>

                </div>

                <p>Ditto is a crazy good card, replacing Crystal Shard completely. The only real downside is they
                    figured out how to nerf Fossil Ditto, no longer changing types. You can’t hit weakness on anything
                    except Colorless-weak Pokémon, and there are very few viable Pokémon that have Colorless weakness.
                    Ditto is primarily used to act as an additional Pokémon-ex in your mirror matches, or to swing 100
                    as a 1 Prizer against something like a Swampert-ex. It additionally functions as a Dunsparce when
                    you lack one, or your opponent is forced to switch to prevent you from using Strike and Run. If you
                    are playing any of the 3 starters, Ditto is a must!</p>

                <h3>Sudowoodo (Aquapolis H24 & 36)</h3><br>

                <p>Don’t like Exploud? Neither does Sudowoodo. The problem is Sudowoodo lacks Prismatic Body, but hits
                    weakness on Dunsparce, Exploud, Delcatty, and deletes Team Magma’s Zangoose. Oh, and it deletes
                    Wigglytuff ex if you find someone bold enough to play it.</p>

                <h3>Wurmple (Dragon 81)</h3><br>

                <p>Most people don’t know about Wurmple, but it's a very cool card. Dunsparce can only grab 3 Pokémon,
                    but if you play all Grass Pokémon, Wurmple is a no-brainer! It literally is Dunsparce with 1 sad
                    exception; you can’t switch after using Call for Friends.This can be relevant, but in my years of
                    playing the format I don’t think the switching changes much except stopping a Ditto. After all, why
                    would you want to keep a bench slot closed with Dunsparce? In Blaziken, you’d rather retreat most
                    times just to get a Fire in your discard. Dustox, while not being crazy good, allows Wurmple to have
                    added utility by becoming a pivot with a Rare Candy, and Toxic being a good attack for a Double
                    Rainbow Energy.</p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week old-card zoomed' src='../../assets/article-images/dr.081.wurmple.jpg'
                        alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                </div>

                <h3>Beedrill (Skyridge H4 & 5)</h3><br>

                <p>Diving into Wurmple reminds me of Skyridge’s strongest soldier, Beedrill. On play, you Paralyze and
                    Poison the Active Pokémon. I think every good player knows that Paralysis is the strongest Special
                    Condition, and Paralysis-Poison is the best combination of all Special Conditions. Beedrill pulls up
                    having no retreat cost, a 2-Colorless attack to fit in any deck, but the only problem is finding his
                    crew. Some have tested it with Exploud, but I believe it may have more use in Crobat. Venom Spray
                    forces switch cards. So, how do you utilize Beedrill effectively? There are several cards:</p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week old-card zoomed' src='../../assets/article-images/sk.005.beedrill.jpg'
                        alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                </div>

                <p>Retro Energy acts as a Devolution Spray, and it’s the only way to actually get Beedrill back to hand.
                    Back to hand? The card says discard! That is correct, but when combined with the aforementioned Lure
                    Ball, you can have a real thing going, while gaining an Energy to attack with it later.</p>

                <p>Undersea Ruins is definitely weaker than Retro Energy, but it saves you space rather than running
                    Super Scoop Up. </p>

                <p>Mr. Briney’s Compassion without a doubt is the best application, but you also lose a Supporter card
                    for the turn. If you try to prioritize Briney over a coin flip, make sure your opponent has a low
                    hand size or you can be ready for a switch out.</p>

                <h3>Corsola (Hidden Legends 32)</h3><br>

                <p>A great card to pivot around with is Corsola. The card is great with High Pressure System and
                    Dunsparce. While you can’t have more than 10 cards with Coral Glow’s effect, it makes an excellent
                    Basic Pokémon with above 50 HP, meaning it can safely pivot into, say, a Blaziken-ex, and not be
                    Knocked Out by its Blaze Kick. I think this card is best when you have High Pressure System.</p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>

                </div>

                <h3>Victreebel (Aquapolis H30 & 42)</h3><br>

                <p>If you are playing Rare Candy and can’t justify Pokémon Reversal, Victreebel could be your
                    replacement to a Bellossom tech. Fragrance Trap is such a good Poké-Power, and is commonly seen play
                    in Machamp. It definitely has potential in Sceptile and Swampert, or maybe in something like
                    Jumpluff/Gorebyss. The real downside is lacking any sort of Resistance to Water.</p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week old-card zoomed'

                </div>

                <h3>Roselia (Dragon 9)</h3><br>

                <p>Based on all the cards mentioned, can you tell that Sceptile-ex is my most tested deck? Roselia is
                    actually a crazy good Pokémon. Like Corsola, it acts as a Dunsparce switch-in with additional
                    effects. One bonus is you won’t ever be Paralyzed by Sudden Flash. Speed Growth works well with
                    Energy Transfer since you should already be running 13-15 Basic Energy in a Sceptile deck. I firmly
                    believe Sceptile-ex is the best deck in the format but has the unfortunate weakness of Fire! One
                    day, I’ll figure out how to be as fast as Blaziken, and my extensive research into the Water Type
                    will end little Torchic’s reign!</p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>

                </div>

                <h3>Latias-ex (Dragon 93)</h3><br>

                <p>Latias-ex is interesting, as it boasts a dual resistance to Psychic and Fighting, while having a
                    reasonable attack for the format that swings 100. Latias has better metrics against Team Magma’s
                    Groudon, as you only need 3 Energy to take a KO, then 2 the following turn. Rayquaza-ex needs 3 to
                    take a KO, and is forced to lose Multi Energy when using Dragon Burst. Latias only needs a Multi
                    Energy, 2 Fire Energy or 2 Water Energy to take KO on Team Magma’s Groudon and other Pokémon with
                    100 HP. The real benefit is not losing a third energy, making this a good Swampert card as you’re
                    already using Magneton to grab Basic Energy back. </p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>

                <h3>Minun (Dragon 7)</h3><br>

                <p>I stumbled upon this card while playing RS-PK (also known by ADV-PCG, EX Series, Klazcynski’s
                    Stantler-Themed Bedroom, etc.). It was played as an additional Rayquaza ex δ while also reducing
                    spread damage. I find myself using this in Blaziken, as a Firestream sets up Special Circuit to take
                    Knock Outs on Delcatty quickly and is unexpected. Its best utility is stopping Exploud from using
                    Breaking Sound liberally, and is forced to drop a Boost or build up a Hyper Voice. What a good
                    Pokémon.</p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week radius-card zoomed' src='../../assets/article-images/dr.007.minun_.jpg'

                </div>

                <h3>Raichu (Skyridge H25 & 27)</h3><br>

                <p>If there is a Raichu in the format, and other ways to spread damage, they can’t stop me from playing
                    Rai-Eggs. I think this card is weaker than Minun, but spreading 20 across the board can’t be all
                    bad? And you can even pair it with Raichu-ex. Being weak to Fighting isn’t a good thing, so you’ll
                    have to find a partner suitable for him. Ancient Technical Machine [Rock]’s new resurgence makes
                    this card have potential.</p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>

                </div>

                <h3>Absol (Dragon 1)</h3><br>

                <p>Don’t like your opponent having 17 cards in hand? Get rid of it! I think Mill is a legitimate
                    strategy in this format, you just need Pokémon that can survive 50 damage. Consider Team Magma’s
                    Torkoal. If your opponent is using an Oracle, Magma Burn removes the top card. The real answer to
                    why these cards aren’t that crazy is because of Town Volunteers, the sheer amount of Acceleration,
                    and you can Oracle around it. Who knows? Maybe you can find a way to use it.</p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>

                </div>

                <h3>Weezing (Ruby & Sapphire 24)</h3><br>

                <p>Confusion Gas is a very good attack to have, only there are plenty of ways to play around it
                    unfortunately. Take the aforementioned Mirage Stadium into the question now, where an opponent has
                    to flip a coin to attack, or flip a coin to retreat. Team Aqua Hideout is also very good with
                    Weezing, the only real downside is Poison Smog not being a single Energy. Double Rainbow doesn’t
                    work because it doesn’t place damage counters, but Warp Energy has a lot of plays with Weezing.
                    Cards like Medicham appreciate the damage spread, and the Poison effect could be enough to take the
                    Knock Out.</p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>

                <h3>Kyogre-ex (Hidden Legends 94)</h3><br>

                <p>Not a commonly played card as most Swampert lists play Suicune-ex. Kyogre-ex functions as a
                    Rayquaza-ex check, as Mark of Antiquity prevents it from attacking. This card’s value comes from the
                    late game, where you can easily use Magneton’s Poké-Power to retrieve lots of Energy in your hand to
                    deal 100 or even more! After that, your deck is likely all Energy, so 2 Energy Draws, plus Magneton
                    gets you the exact amount of cards shuffled if your deck is thin. Sniping 20 anywhere isn’t bad
                    either, softening thing for Swampert-ex.</p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>

                </div>

                <h3>Slaking (Ruby & Sapphire 12)</h3><br>

                <p>Lazy is by far one of the best Poké-Bodies in the game, but this card has a hard time finding its
                    place in the meta. I wanted to dedicate an entire page to Slaking, as I firmly believe it can exist
                    in the meta. Let’s start with its pros:</p>

                <p>Its Colorless typing makes Friend Ball more useful than Oracle, meaning you don’t necessarily need
                    Delcatty in its list.</p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week old-card zoomed' src='../../assets/article-images/rs.012.slaking.jpg'
                        alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                </div>

                <p>Critical Move isn’t that bad of a cost when you factor in Boost Energy and Warp Energy.
                    Having 2 in play doesn’t allow Warp Point to get around. Unlike Muk-ex, it doesn’t give up 2 Prizes
                    and has MORE HP than Muk-ex.
                    Memory Berry could be viable here because of Vigoroth’s Rage attack and Slakoth’s Slack Off. Due to
                    the unforeseen consequence of Capitalism, Meteor Falls wasn’t printed until Deoxys. Had it been, I
                    could see Slaking really being a threat.</p>

                <p>What about its cons? That should be rather obvious, but let’s list them for consistency:</p>

                <p>Being weak to Fighting Type Pokémon is not good, and gets absolutely dumpstered by Team Magma. To
                    counter this, consider the Sceptile engine to check Groudon.
                    4 Energy cost attacks aren’t really good, and the condition to discard a Basic really limits the
                    Pokémon you can pair it with. That being said, Swampert and Blaziken could play this card.
                    Historically, Blaziken has already run Salamence to sneak out KOs, so why not slow your opponent
                    down while you set up?</p>

                <h3><i>Conclusion:</i></h3><br>

                <p> The 2004 Worlds Format is a wonderful format that I hope you can participate in soon. Before I go, I
                    wanted to give my overall thoughts on the format as a whole:
                    The skill gap in this format is kind of big. Similar to Base-Fossil, while somewhat inconsistent,
                    falls to the player’s deck list most times; your entire deck matters in 2004, meaning every card you
                    add will be seen and needs to have utility at multiple stages of the game.
                    Games will go in the motions of their sequencing, especially against decks like Blaziken.</p>
                <p>The decks
                    that tend to accelerate Energy almost always have identical turns. Determining optimal lines of play
                    can be achieved in just a few games, because there’s quite a lot of time to pick up on plays even
                    during a match. You HAVE time to catch-up after a KO, but it’s a matter of, “Can my deck get access
                    to what it needs as quickly as my opponent in the second half?” This is why Blaziken aiming down
                    Delcatty is usually more important than aiming down their Blaziken first.</p>
                <p id='twostrong'><strong><i>The best decks in the format are, without a doubt, Blaziken and Team
                            Magma.</i></strong></p>

                    <p style='margin-top: 10px;margin-bottom: -8px;'>View other decks from the <a

                </div>
                <p> That being said, there
                    are plenty of ways to counter these decks, and almost every deck has several 50/50 matchup spreads.
                    The Magnecat Engine allows many decks to exist in the format. Did you know that Vileplume ex is a
                    crazy Pokémon to have in this format? It’s true! Getting it out early shuts down Rare Candy and
                    forces your opponent to take it slow like you, and your opponent can’t Warp Point or Switch around
                    its potential Confusion infliction. We didn’t even talk about Bellossom from Aquapolis being the
                    only Grass Accelerator with a Poké-Power, and you can pair it with Gloom if you’re afraid of Grass
                    Resistance. The cardpool is simply too large for this format to be excused as “The Magma format.”
                </p>
                <div class='center-cards-of-week'>
                    <img class='card-of-the-week-mid-multi zoomed' src='../../assets/cards/2004-2006/vileplume-ex.png'
                        alt='pokemon card of the week' />
                    <img class='card-of-the-week-mid-multi zoomed' src='../../assets/cards/2004-2006/bellossom.png'

                </div>

                <p>Overall, I rate this format as a 7.8/10, because of the LACK of Water type dominance in this format.
                    There is definitely some skill, but the slowness can lead to steamrolling. This is why I find
                    Dunsparce to be critical in the majority of decks, and your decklist needs to be absolutely perfect.
